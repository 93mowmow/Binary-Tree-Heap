Binary-Tree-Heap
================

C++ implementation of a heap and heap sort through use of a binary tree structure.

Problems:
Insert() 
  - need to perculate more than 1 level for very large number cases
Remove()
  - swap the root with the last inserted node and then perform max_heap removal
HeapSort()
  - will be fixed once remove() is complete
