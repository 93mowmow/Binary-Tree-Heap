Binary-Tree-Heap
================

C++ implementation of a heap and heap sort through use of a binary tree structure via Max_Heap Implementation.


DISCLAIMER: Project is still ongoing, and there are still a few problems.


Problems:

Insert() 
  - need to perculate more than 1 level for very large number cases

Remove()
  - swap the root with the last inserted node and then perform max_heap removal

HeapSort()
  - will be fixed once remove() is complete
